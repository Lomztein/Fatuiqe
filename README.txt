A game about fleeing and running

Perhaps you have once played the game Silhouette? This game is going to
be based on the same 2 player flee/hunt mechanic, but in a first person
perspective, and a lot of other stuff.

The fleeing player will do just that; flee.

The hunter will have tons of stuff he can do to mess with the fleeing
dude, such as triggering differint creepy sounds, such as children laughing
or a deep, evil laugh. He can also place objects to lure or trap the player

Its all going to take place in a simplistic enviroment with low-poly models
and simplistic, mostly gray/white textures with perhaps a little noise.

Other mechanics might be added. Not much have really been planned.

LOOK! I can do ze edit!
